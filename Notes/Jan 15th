1.  Looking to understand the transmission spectrum code.
2.  Adapt notebook to run multiple times with variable inputs.
3.  Figure out if we use the blue line or another with researching differences.
4.  Form simulated JWST spectrum for analysis group.
5.  Estimate atmospheric composition for mean molecular weight
6.  Pick a wavelength range for which feature we want to measure the height of
