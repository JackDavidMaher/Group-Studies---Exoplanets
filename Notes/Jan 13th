We are looking at sub-Neptunes with the JWST

Mission:
Plan a large (roughly 100-200 hours, up to 500 hours) JWST program to identify trends in sub-Neptune atmospheres
    - Simulate exoplanet atmosphere observations
    - Find which targets and observationsare needed to identify a trend in cloudiness vs temperature.
    We are looking at known exoplanets so we are not going to waste time waiting for a transit.
