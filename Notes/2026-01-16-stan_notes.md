management plan due


getting head around the whole project from team 2's perspective 

the goal is essentially to create a list of targets that we think would provide enough data if observed to confirm/deny the expected trend in spectrum feature height vs planetary temperature 

this list comes from deciding 
A. How many planets
B. Which ones

(obviously the ones we pick will determine how many needed - 'better' planets/picks = less planets needed)

this is super iterative so we will probs be able to say quite early 'if you observed all these you could confirm trend' but it will be unfeasibly large/time intensive. 
	Then the task will be to refine this as MUCH AS POSSIBLE to get a (still confident) minimum time needed. 

the refining works in a few ways:
1. better target list
2. better analysis code/fitting scheme
3. better modelling (team 1)




today:
fed back on management plan with Sam (looking good),
moved some folders around with code and data, 
rewriting filtering code for legibility and ease of reuse

QUESTION: how do we deal with multiple rows for each planet with different data?

- deal with this next time
